# Heat Pump Control Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

Welcome to the repository of my master thesis. Unfortunately, the simulation and the price data which were used in the thesis are not public. Therefore, only parts of the code could be made publicly available. The thesis itself will be published here as well after it was submitted officially to the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences.

The repository is structured as follows:

### baseline_results

This folder contains the data of the baseline methods wich were used for comparison.

### code

This folder contains the code which was used in the master thesis. Further information can be found in the provided jupyter notebooks.

### models 

The models trained are stored in this folder
